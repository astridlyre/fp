My little functional programming library. Just a few functions I don't like
re-writing. I am slowly adding tests, run with `npm run test` and you should see
82 test passing.

Features:

- Many utility functions, such as `compose`, `pipe`, and `curry`.
- Some ADTs such as `Maybe`, `Result`, and `IO`
- A simple reactive library for `Observable`, including methods like `map`,
  `filter`, and `reduce`.
